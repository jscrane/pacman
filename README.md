Pac Man
========

Pacman emulation on
[Stellarpad](http://www.energia.nu/Guide_StellarisLaunchPad.html) using 
[Energia](http://energia.nu/).

Frisnit's [Pac Man Emulator](http://www.frisnit.com/pac-man-machine-emulator/)
was a useful reference, as was Chris Lomont's [Pac Man emulation 
guide](http://www.lomont.org/Software/Games/PacMan/PacmanEmulation.pdf).
The latter is reproduced [here](docs/PacmanEmulation.pdf).
